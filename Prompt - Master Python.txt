Instructions: 

1. Refer the topics to below to handle concepts and problem separately - to handle the input below 
2. No matter concept or problem part you are giving me, REMEMBER go ONE at a time, I REPEAT ONE AT A TIME 
3. REMEMBER THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: Also only and only when i explicitly ask for code or the answer you must give me, other times just solve my doubt at hand. Go step by step, remember the flow of session, even if i ask doubts clarify them and get to back to flow, don't get side tracked

Follow this for concepts:
    For each concept explain it by example. After that give me a similar problem to get hands on immediately after explaining the concept by example

Follow this problems:
    For each problem given enhance the questions, and add a challenge a question after all the questions i gave are solved by me - remember for the questions you are not supposed give me hints/answers/code but just a detailed explanation like in LEETCODE (the style as well) with test cases (max 3)
