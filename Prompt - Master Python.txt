concept by concept with example and problem to practice. Finally once all concepts are over, enhance the questions, and add a challenge a question after all the questions i gave are solved by me - remember for the questions you are not supposed give me hints/answers/code but just a detailed explanation like in leetcode with test cases (max 3). Also only and only when i explicitly ask for code or the answer you must give me, other times just solve my doubt at hand. Go step by step, remember the flow of session, even if i ask doubts clarify them and get to back to flow, don't get side tracked
